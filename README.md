# Customer Satisfaction Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes airline customer satisfaction data and builds a Machine Learning model to predict whether a customer is satisfied or not.

The goal is to identify key factors that influence customer satisfaction and build a predictive model.

---

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains information related to:
- Customer demographics
- Type of travel
- Travel class
- Flight distance
- In-flight services
- Delays
- Satisfaction level (Target Variable)

---

##  Data Cleaning Steps
- Checked and handled missing values
- Removed duplicate rows
- Cleaned column names
- Converted categorical features into numeric format using One-Hot Encoding

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed satisfaction distribution
- Compared satisfaction across travel classes
- Visualized feature correlations using heatmap
- Identified important factors affecting satisfaction

---

##  Machine Learning Model
- Model Used: Logistic Regression
- Train-Test Split: 80% Training, 20% Testing
- Encoded categorical variables using `pd.get_dummies()`
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

---

##  Model Performance
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of **XX%**.

The model successfully predicts customer satisfaction based on service-related features.

---

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

##  Conclusion
The analysis shows that travel class, service quality, and delays significantly impact customer satisfaction.

The trained model performs well and can be used for predicting customer satisfaction in future scenarios.
